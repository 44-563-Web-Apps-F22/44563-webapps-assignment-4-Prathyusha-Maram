        SCENE—JOSEPHINE

                      The hours creep on apace,
                        My guilty heart is quaking!
                      Oh, that I might retrace
                        The step that I am taking!
                 Its folly it were easy to be showing,
                 What I am giving up and whither going.
                 On the one hand, papa's luxurious home,
                   Hung with ancestral armour and old brasses,
                 Carved oak and tapestry from distant Rome,
                   Rare "blue and white" Venetian finger-glasses,
                 Rich oriental rugs, luxurious sofa pillows,
                 And everything that isn't old, from Gillow's.
                 And on the other, a dark and dingy room,
                   In some back street with stuffy children crying,
                 Where organs yell, and clacking housewives fume,
                   And clothes are hanging out all day a-drying.
                 With one cracked looking-glass to see your face
  in,
                 And dinner served up in a pudding basin!

                      A simple sailor, lowly born,
                           Unlettered and unknown,
                      Who toils for bread from early mom
                           Till half the night has flown!
                      No golden rank can he impart—
                           No wealth of house or land—
                      No fortune save his trusty heart
                           And honest brown right hand!
                           And yet he is so wondrous fair
                           That love for one so passing rare,
                           So peerless in his manly beauty,
                           Were little else than solemn duty!
                 Oh, god of love, and god of reason, say,
                 Which of you twain shall my poor heart obey!

                        SIR JOSEPH and CAPTAIN enter

    SIR JOSEPH. Madam, it has been represented to me that you are
  appalled
  by my exalted rank. I desire to convey to you officially my
  assurance,
  that if your hesitation is attributable to that circumstance, it
  is
  uncalled for.
    JOS. Oh! then your lordship is of opinion that married
  happiness is not
  inconsistent with discrepancy in rank?
    SIR JOSEPH. I am officially of that opinion.
    JOS. That the high and the lowly may be truly happy together,
  provided
  that they truly love one another?
    SIR JOSEPH. Madam, I desire to convey to you officially my
  opinion that
  love is a platform upon which all ranks meet.
    JOS. I thank you, Sir Joseph. I did hesitate, but I will
  hesitate no
  longer. (Aside.) He little thinks how eloquently he has pleaded
  his
  rival's cause!

                                   TRIO

                 Love can level ranks, and therefore,
                 Though his lordship's station's mighty,
                   Though stupendous be his brain,
                 Though your tastes are mean and flighty
                   And your fortune poor and plain,

  SIR JOSEPH.    Never mind the why and wherefore,
                 Love can level ranks, and therefore,
                 Though your nautical relation (alluding to CAPT.)
                   In my set could scarcely pass—
                 Though you occupy a station

  JOS.           Never mind the why and wherefore,
                 Love can level ranks, and therefore
                 I admit the jurisdiction;
                      Ably have you played your part;
                 You have carried firm conviction
                      To my hesitating heart.
  CAPT. and      Ring the merry bells on board-ship,
  SIR JOSEPH.    Rend the air with warbling wild,

    CAPT. Sir Joseph, I cannot express to you my delight at the
  happy
  result of your eloquence. Your argument was unanswerable.
    SIR JOSEPH. Captain Corcoran, it is one of the happiest
  characteristics
  of this glorious country that official utterances are invariably
  regarded
  as unanswerable.                                        [Exit SIR
  JOSEPH.
    CAPT. At last my fond hopes are to be crowned. My only daughter
  is to
  be the bride of a Cabinet Minister. The prospect is Elysian.
  (During this
  speech DICK DEADEYE has entered.)
    DICK. Captain.
    CAPT. Deadeye! You here? Don't! (Recoiling from him.)
    DICK. Ah, don't shrink from me, Captain. I'm unpleasant to look
  at, and
  my name's agin me, but I ain't as bad as I seem.
    CAPT. What would you with me?
    DICK (mysteriously). I'm come to give you warning.
    CAPT. Indeed! do you propose to leave the Navy then?
    DICK. No, no, you misunderstand me; listen!

                                     DUET
                            CAPTAIN and DICK DEADEYE

    DICK.        Kind Captain, I've important information,
                         Sing hey, the kind commander that you are,
                 About a certain intimate relation,
                    Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.
    BOTH.        The merry maiden and the tar.

    CAPT.        Good fellow, in conundrums you are speaking,
                    Sing hey, the mystic sailor that you are;
                 The answer to them vainly I am seeking;
                    Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.
    BOTH              The merry maiden and the tar.

    DICK.        Kind Captain, your young lady is a-sighing,
                    Sing hey, the simple captain that you are,
                 This very might with Rackstraw to be flying;
                    Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.
    BOTH.                  The merry maiden and the tar.

    CAPT.        Good fellow, you have given timely warning,
                    Sing hey, the thoughtful sailor that you are,
                 I'll talk to Master Rackstraw in the morning:
                    Sing hey, the cat-o'-nine-tails and the tar.
                                                    (Producing a
  "cat".)

    BOTH.        The merry cat-o'-nine-tails and the tar!

    CAPT. Dick Deadeye—I thank you for your warning—I will at
  once take
  means to arrest their flight. This boat cloak will afford me
  ample
  disguise—So! (Envelops himself in a mysterious cloak, holding it
  before
  his face.)
    DICK. Ha, ha! They are foiled—foiled—foiled!

    Enter Crew on tiptoe, with RALPH and BOATSWAIN meeting
  JOSEPHINE, who
       enters from cabin on tiptoe, with bundle of necessaries, and
       accompanied by LITTLE BUTTERCUP.

                                  ENSEMBLE

                      Carefully on tiptoe stealing,
                        Breathing gently as we may,
                      Every step with caution feeling,
                        We will softly steal away.

                          (CAPTAIN stamps)—Chord.

    ALL (much alarmed). Goodness me—
                             Why, what was that?
    DICK.                Silent be,
                             It was the cat!
    ALL. (reassured).    It was—it was the cat!
    CAPT. (producing cat-o'-nine-tails). They're right, it was the
  cat!

    ALL.                 Pull ashore, in fashion steady,
                           Hymen will defray the fare,
                         For a clergyman is ready
                           To unite the happy pair!

    ALL.                 Goodness me,
                           Why, what was that?
    DICK.                Silent be,
                           Again the cat!
    ALL.                 It was again that cat!

    CAPT. (throwing off cloak). Hold! (All start.)
                           Pretty daughter of mine,
                             I insist upon knowing
                             Where you may be going
                           With these sons of the brine,
                             For my excellent crew,
                           Though foes they could thump any,
                           Are scarcely fit company,
                             My daughter, for you.
    CREW.                    Now, hark at that, do!
                           Though foes we could thump any,
                           We are scarcely fit company

    RALPH.               Proud officer, that haughty lip uncurl!
                 Vain man, suppress that supercilious sneer,
            For I have dared to love your matchless girl,
               A fact well known to all my messmates here!

    BOAT.        He is an Englishman!
                   For he himself has said it,
                   And it's greatly to his credit,
                 That he is an Englishman!

    ALL.         That he is an Englishman!
    BOAT.        For he might have been a Roosian,
                 A French, or Turk, or Proosian,
                 Or perhaps Itali-an!

    ALL.         Or perhaps Itali-an!

                 To belong to other nations,
                   He remains an Englishman!

    ALL.         For in spite of all temptations, etc.

    CAPT. (trying to repress his anger).
                  In uttering a reprobation
                    To any British tar,
                  I try to speak with moderation,
                    But you have gone too far.
                  I'm very sorry to disparage
                    A humble foremast lad,
                  But to seek your captain's child in marriage,
                    Why damme, it's too bad

       [During this, COUSIN HEBE and FEMALE RELATIVES have entered.

        ALL (shocked). Oh!
        CAPT.          Yes, damme, it's too bad!
        ALL.                 Oh!
        CAPT. and DICK DEADEYE. Yes, damme, it s too bad.

       [During this, SIR JOSEPH has appeared on poop-deck. He is
  horrified
            at the bad language.

    HEBE.             Did you hear him? Did you hear him?
                        Oh, the monster overbearing!
                      Don't go near him—don't go near him—
                        He is swearing—he is swearing!
    SIR JOSEPH.       My pain and my distress,
                        I find it is not easy to express;
                        My amazement—my surprise—
                      You may learn from the expression of my eyes!
    CAPT.             My lord—one word—the facts are not before
  you
                        The word was injudicious, I allow—
                      But hear my explanation, I implore you,
                        And you will be indignant too, I vow!
    SIR JOSEPH.       I will hear of no defence,
                        Attempt none if you're sensible.
                      That word of evil sense
                        Is wholly indefensible.
                      Go, ribald, get you hence
                        To your cabin with celerity.
                      This is the consequence
                        Of ill-advised asperity

                           [Exit CAPTAIN, disgraced, followed by
  JOSEPHINE

    ALL.              This is the consequence,
                        Of ill-advised asperity!
    SIR JOSEPH.       For I'll teach you all, ere long,
                        To refrain from language strong
                      For I haven't any sympathy for ill-bred
  taunts!
    HEBE.             No more have his sisters, nor his cousins,
  nor his
                           aunts.
    ALL.              For he is an Englishman, etc.

    SIR JOSEPH. Now, tell me, my fine fellow—for you are a fine
  fellow—
    RALPH. Yes, your honour.
    SIR JOSEPH. How came your captain so far to forget himself? I
  am quite
  sure you had given him no cause for annoyance.
    RALPH, Please your honour, it was thus-wise. You see I'm only a
  topman-
  -a mere foremast hand—
    SIR JOSEPH. Don't be ashamed of that. Your position as a topman
  is a
  very exalted one.
    RALPH. Well, your honour, love burns as brightly in the
  fo'c'sle as it
  does on the quarter-deck, and Josephine is the fairest bud that
  ever
  blossomed upon the tree of a poor fellow's wildest hopes.

                      Enter JOSEPHINE; she rushes to RALPH'S arms

    JOS. Darling! (SIR JOSEPH horrified.)
    RALPH. She is the figurehead of my ship of life—the bright
  beacon that
  guides me into my port of happiness—that the rarest, the purest
  gem that
  ever sparkled on a poor but worthy fellow's trusting brow!
    ALL. Very pretty, very pretty!
    SIR JOSEPH. Insolent sailor, you shall repent this outrage.
  Seize him!
    (Two Marines seize him and handcuff him.)
    JOS. Oh, Sir Joseph, spare him, for I love him tenderly.
    SIR JOSEPH. Pray, don't. I will teach this presumptuous mariner
  to
  discipline his affections. Have you such a thing as a dungeon on
  board?
    ALL. We have!
    DICK. They have!
    SIR JOSEPH. Then load him with chains and take him there at
  once!
